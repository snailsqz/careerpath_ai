‘From Climate Science to Action’ is divided into four weeks. The first two weeks will provide a comprehensive overview of the scientific evidence for climate change, followed by region-specific insights on the impacts of a warmer world in the 21st century. The last two weeks will focus on action strategies that are being undertaken in different regions and countries to meet the climate challenge, and how you as an individual can take action to avoid a warmer world!

Week 1:  Climate Change in the 21st Century

•  Historical and projected observed changes in the climate system, leading up to the end of the 21st century
•  The potential of Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) submitted at COP 21 from 187 countries to induce climate action
•  Trends in climate change impacts, including loss of Arctic sea ice, melting glaciers, increased heat waves and extreme temperatures, and drought and aridity 
•  Possible responses from natural systems, explaining how warming could result in sea-level rise, heat waves and extreme temperatures, and ocean acidification

Week 2: Sectoral and Regional Impacts

•  Impacts on key development sectors—from warming above pre-industrial temperatures and projected climate trends—across each of the world’s regions
•  Sectoral impacts focusing on agricultural production, water resources, ecosystem services, and coastal vulnerability for affected populations 
•  Importance of risks with the potential to reverse hard-won development gains and potentially trap millions in poverty, illustrating the need for urgent action now

Week 3: From Science to Action on Climate Change

•  Region-specific discussions on mitigation actions needed to reduce emissions while decreasing vulnerability to climate change impacts through adaptation and by building climate resilience
•  Perspectives from regional experts on their experiences in strategies and actions proposed in each region to help transition towards a low-emissions, climate-resilient development path 
•  Discussions on the progress of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), outcomes of the Paris Agreement and reflections from the Conference of Parties (COP)22

Week 4: What You Can Do

•  Transformative impact of day-to-day changes when brought to a global scale
•  The rationale for acting now, acting together and acting differently
•  Examples and expected benefits of mitigation and adaptation policies, considering both contributions to global emission reductions and local development opportunities

A modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called “intellectual property” or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer:  a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design.  Our focus in this part of the course is on the key logical and geometric representations that make it possible to map from logic to layout, and in particular, to place, route, and evaluate the timing of large logic networks. Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: technology mapping, timing analysis, and ASIC placement and routing.

SxXuFKkyEeyjPxJkzIUqCw,Build an End-to-End Data Capture Pipeline using Document AI,"This is a self-paced lab that takes place in the Google Cloud console. In this lab you use Cloud Functions and Pub/Sub to create an end-to-end document processing pipeline using Document AI. The Document AI API is a document understanding solution that takes unstructured data, such as documents and emails, and makes the data easier to understand, analyze, and consume.

In this lab, you will create a document processing pipeline that will automatically process documents that are uploaded to Cloud Storage. The pipeline consists of a primary Cloud Function that processes new files that are uploaded to Cloud Storage using a Document AI form processor and then saves form data detected in those files to BigQuery. If the form data includes any address fields the address data is then written to a Pub/Sub topic that in turn triggers a second Cloud Function that uses to Geocoding API to provide geographic coordinate data for the address that is also written to BigQuery.

This is a simple pipeline that uses a general form processor that will detect basic form data, such as a labelled field containing address information. Document AI processors that use one of the specialized parsers that are beyond the scope of this lab provide enhanced entity information for specific document types even when those documents do not include labelled fields. For example, a Document AI Invoice parser can provide detailed address and supplier information, from an unlabelled invoice document because it understands the layout of invoices.",BEGINNER,1 hour,Software Development,VerifiedCert,,https://www.coursera.org/learn/googlecloud-build-an-end-to-end-data-capture-pipeline-using-document-ai-wiisg

This course is designed to help you develop your leadership competencies through experiential learning, reflection, and applying new approaches based on what you learn. It consists of 6 modules which present different themes in the renewable energy transition, particularly: justice in the energy transition (Module 2), participatory practices with local community members (Module 3), perspectives of other-than-humans (Module 4), alternative ownership and governance models (Module 5), and the management of wicked problems in transitions (Module 6). Additionally, each module provides exercises to help you apply the gained insights in your daily work as a leader in the wind energy sector.

Steering towards a just and effective wind energy system demands strong leadership. While the idea of a strong leader is often associated with someone dominant, assertive, and focused on clear, immediate outcomes, the complexity and uncertainty involved in the wind energy transition require a different approach. As the EU works toward reaching its goal of 45 % renewable energy by 2030, accelerating wind energy presents a range of challenges. It is not just about what is technically and financially possible. Local authorities and developers involved in wind energy focus on economic, social, and environmental issues to transform the wind energy system towards greater justice and effectiveness.

Therefore, these 6 modules place a strong emphasis on developing transition leadership competencies such as deep listening, reflecting on your assumptions, considering the perspectives of others, facilitating collective learning, and collaborating with different actors.
