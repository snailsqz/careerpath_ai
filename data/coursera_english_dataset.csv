A modern VLSI chip is a remarkably complex beast:  billions of transistors, millions of logic gates deployed for computation and control, big blocks of memory, embedded blocks of pre-designed functions designed by third parties (called “intellectual property” or IP blocks).  How do people manage to design these complicated chips?  Answer:  a sequence of computer aided design (CAD) tools takes an abstract description of the chip, and refines it step-wise to a final design. This class focuses on the major design tools used in the creation of an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) or System on Chip (SoC) design.  Our focus in this part of the course is on the key logical and geometric representations that make it possible to map from logic to layout, and in particular, to place, route, and evaluate the timing of large logic networks. Our goal is for students to understand how the tools themselves work, at the level of their fundamental algorithms and data structures. Topics covered will include: technology mapping, timing analysis, and ASIC placement and routing.

This is a simple pipeline that uses a general form processor that will detect basic form data, such as a labelled field containing address information. Document AI processors that use one of the specialized parsers that are beyond the scope of this lab provide enhanced entity information for specific document types even when those documents do not include labelled fields.

This course is designed to help you develop your leadership competencies through experiential learning, reflection, and applying new approaches based on what you learn. It consists of 6 modules which present different themes in the renewable energy transition, particularly: justice in the energy transition (Module 2), participatory practices with local community members (Module 3), perspectives of other-than-humans (Module 4), alternative ownership and governance models (Module 5), and the management of wicked problems in transitions (Module 6). Additionally, each module provides exercises to help you apply the gained insights in your daily work as a leader in the wind energy sector.

Steering towards a just and effective wind energy system demands strong leadership. While the idea of a strong leader is often associated with someone dominant, assertive, and focused on clear, immediate outcomes, the complexity and uncertainty involved in the wind energy transition require a different approach. As the EU works toward reaching its goal of 45 % renewable energy by 2030, accelerating wind energy presents a range of challenges. It is not just about what is technically and financially possible. Local authorities and developers involved in wind energy focus on economic, social, and environmental issues to transform the wind energy system towards greater justice and effectiveness.

Therefore, these 6 modules place a strong emphasis on developing transition leadership competencies such as deep listening, reflecting on your assumptions, considering the perspectives of others, facilitating collective learning, and collaborating with different actors. Completing this course, you have broadened your leadership competencies to navigate the complex and uncertain realities of the renewable energy transition.",INTERMEDIATE,English,https://www.coursera.org/learn/jw4a

Unlike tables or simple lists, knowledge graphs can capture the meaning and context behind the data, allowing you to uncover insights and connections that would be difficult to find with conventional databases. This rich, structured context is ideal for improving the output of large language models (LLMs), because you can build more relevant context for the model than with semantic search alone. 

This course will teach you how to leverage knowledge graphs within retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications. You’ll learn to:

1. Understand the basics of how knowledge graphs store data by using nodes to represent entities and edges to represent relationships between nodes.

2. Use Neo4j’s query language, Cypher, to retrieve information from a fun graph of movie and actor data.

3. Add a vector index to a knowledge graph to represent unstructured text data and find relevant texts using vector similarity search.

4. Build a knowledge graph of text documents from scratch, using publicly available financial and investment documents as the demo use case

5. Explore advanced techniques for connecting multiple knowledge graphs and using complex queries for comprehensive data retrieval.

6. Write advanced Cypher queries to retrieve relevant information from the graph and format it for inclusion in your prompt to an LLM.

After course completion, you’ll be well-equipped to use knowledge graphs to uncover deeper insights in your data, and enhance the performance of LLMs with structured, relevant context.",INTERMEDIATE,English,https://www.coursera.org/learn/knowledge-graphs-rag

wyqudWu8EeufExI7Hdi1lQ,SQL CASE Statements,"Welcome to this project-based course, SQL CASE Statements. In this project, you will learn how to use SQL CASE statements to query tables in a database.
By the end of this 2-hour long project, you will be able to write simple CASE statements to retrieve the desired result from a database. Then, we will move systematically to write more complex SQL CASE statements. Furthermore, we will see how to use the CASE clause together with aggregate functions, and SQL joins to get the desired result you want from tables in a database. Also, you will learn how to use the CASE clause to transpose the result of a query.

Also, for this hands-on project, we will use PostgreSQL as our preferred database management system (DBMS). Therefore, to complete this project, it is required that you have prior experience with using PostgreSQL. Similarly, this project is an advanced SQL concept; so, a good foundation for writing SQL queries, and performing joins in SQL is vital to complete this project.
If you are not familiar with writing queries in SQL and SQL joins and want to learn these concepts, start with my previous guided projects titled “Querying Databases using SQL SELECT statement"", “Performing Data Aggregation using SQL Aggregate Functions” and “Mastering SQL Joins”. I taught these guided projects using PostgreSQL. So, taking these projects will give the needed requisite to complete this project on SQL CASE Statements. However, if you are comfortable writing queries in PostgreSQL, please join me on this wonderful ride! Let’s get our hands dirty!",ADVANCED,English,https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-case-statements
